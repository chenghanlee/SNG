      <h5>Terms of Service<h5>
      <p>
      These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the services, websites, and applications offered by SAVNG (the "Service"). Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms.
      </p>

      <h5>Use of the Service</h5>
      <p>
      You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with SAVNG, and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations. You must provide us accurate information, including your real name, when you create your account on SAVNG.

      We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service, to you or to users generally; or create usage limits for the Service.

      You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password. We encourage you to use "strong" passwords (that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. SAVNG will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this instruction.
      </p>

      <h5>User Content</h5>

      <p>
      "Content" means any information, text, graphics, or other materials uploaded, downloaded or appearing on the Service. You retain ownership of all Content you submit, post, display, or otherwise make available on the Service.</p>

      <h5>Your License to SAVNG</h5>

      <p>
      By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the Service, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed).
      </p>
      
      <p>
      You agree that this license includes the right for other users of the Service to modify your Content, and for SAVNG to make your Content available to others for the publication, distribution, syndication, or broadcast of such Content on other media and services, subject to our terms and conditions for such Content use. Such additional uses by SAVNG or others may be made with no compensation paid to you with respect to the Content that you submit, post, transmit or otherwise make available through the Service.
      </p>

      <p>
      We may modify or adapt your Content in order to transmit, display or distribute it over computer networks and in various media and/or make changes to your Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that Content to any requirements or limitations of any networks, devices, services or media.
      </p>

      <p>
      Additionally, by uploading content to the site, you warrant, represent and agree that you have the right to grant SAVNG the license described above. You also represent, warrant and agree that you have not and will not contribute any Content that (a) infringes, violates or otherwise interferes with any copyright or trademark of another party, (b) reveals any trade secret, unless the trade secret belongs to you or you have the owner's permission to disclose it, (c) infringes any intellectual property right of another or the privacy or publicity rights of another, (d) is libelous, defamatory, abusive, threatening, harassing, hateful, offensive or otherwise violates any law or right of any third party, (e) creates an impression that you know is incorrect, misleading, or deceptive, including by impersonating others or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity; (f) contains other people's private or personally identifiable information without their express authorization and permission, and/or (g) contains or links to a virus, trojan horse, worm, time bomb or other computer programming routine or engine that is intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or information. SAVNG reserves the right in its discretion to remove any Content from the Site, suspend or terminate your account at any time, or pursue any other remedy or relief available under equity or law.
      </p>

      <h5>SAVNG's Licenses to You</h5>

      <p>
      Subject to these Terms, SAVNG gives you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to re-post any of the Content on SAVNG anywhere on the rest of the web provided that the Content was added to the Service after April 22, 2010, and provided that the user who created the content has not explicitly marked the content as not for reproduction, and provided that you: (a) do not modify the Content; (b) attribute SAVNG by name in readable text and with a human and machine-followable link (an HTML anchor tag) linking back to the page displaying the original source of the content on quora.com on every page that contains SAVNG content; (c) upon request, either by SAVNG or a user, remove the user's name from Content which the user has subsequently made anonymous; (d) upon request, either by SAVNG or by a user who contributed to the Content, make a reasonable effort to update a particular piece of Content to the latest version on quora.com; and (e) upon request, either by SAVNG or by a user who contributed to the Content, make a reasonable attempt to delete Content that has been deleted or marked as not for reproduction on quora.com.
      </p>

      <p>

      <p>
      If you operate a search engine or robot, or you republish a significant fraction of all SAVNG Content (as we may determine in our reasonable discretion), you must additionally follow these rules:

      </p>

      </p>

      <p>

You can see an example of such a publication at http://www.chillingeffects.org/fairuse/notice.cgi?NoticeID=16887. A link to your published notice will be displayed on SAVNG in place of the removed content.
      </p>

      <p>
      We reserve the right to remove Content alleged to be infringing or otherwise illegal without prior notice and at our sole discretion. In appropriate circumstances, SAVNG will also terminate a user's account if the user is determined to be a repeat infringer.

      <p>
      TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SAVNG AND ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, PARTNERS AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (i) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE; (ii) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (iii) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICE; AND (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT SAVNG HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
      </p>

      <p>
      Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you.
      </p>

      <p>
      If anyone brings a claim against us related to your actions or Content on the Service, or actions or Content by or from someone using your account, you will indemnify and hold us harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable legal fees and costs) related to such claim.
      </p>

      <h5>General Terms</h5>

      <p>
      These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of Texas without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions or your state or country of residence. Unless submitted to arbitration as set forth in the following paragraph, all claims, legal proceedings or litigation arising in connection with the Service will be brought solely in Colin County, Texas, and you consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.
      </p>

      <p>
      For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) under these Terms where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. The party electing such arbitration shall initiate the arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, as selected by the party initiating the arbitration; b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
      </p>

      <p>
      These Terms are the entire and exclusive agreement between SAVNG and you regarding the Service (excluding any services for which you have a separate agreement with SAVNG that is explicitly in addition or in place of these Terms), and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between SAVNG and you regarding the Service.
      </p>

      <p>
      The failure of SAVNG to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
      </p>

      <p>
      We may revise these Terms from time to time. The most current version will always be on this page (or such other page as the Service may indicate). If the revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you via posting to our website or e-mail to the email associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
